ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview

1. Inverted Index, Positional Index, Boolean Queries, and Proximity Queries
- Objective: Implement search engine components for documents, including inverted and positional indexes, to handle Boolean and proximity queries.
- **Approach:**
  - Developed an **inverted index** for efficient term-based searching.
  - Created a **positional index** to support phrase and proximity queries.
  - Implemented **Boolean queries** using logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`).
  - Supported **proximity queries** for searching within specific word distances.

### 2. Spelling Correction and Wildcard Queries
- **Objective:** Enhance search engine functionality with spelling correction and support for wildcard queries.
- **Approach:**
  - Implemented a **spelling correction algorithm** using edit distance to suggest correct spellings.
  - Developed a system for handling **wildcard queries**, allowing flexible search patterns by expanding terms with wildcards.

### 3. Index Block Merging, Gamma Coding, and Bit Manipulation
- **Objective:** Optimize indexing and storage through advanced techniques.
- **Approach:**
  - Implemented **index block merging** to efficiently combine index segments.
  - Applied **gamma coding** for compressing index data and reducing storage requirements.
  - Utilized **bit manipulation techniques** to further optimize index storage and retrieval.

### 4. Document Ranking using Vector Space, Probabilistic, and Language Models
- **Objective:** Implement and compare different document ranking models in an information retrieval system.
- **Approach:**
  - Developed document ranking algorithms based on:
    - **Vector Space Model (VSM)**
    - **Probabilistic Model**
    - **Language Model**
  - Compared the effectiveness of these models in retrieving relevant documents, considering factors like **TF-IDF** and **probabilistic relevance**.

### 5. Naive Bayes Classification, Word Embedding, SVM, and LSA
- **Objective:** Explore various text classification and representation techniques.
- **Approach:**
  - Implemented **Naive Bayes** for simple yet effective text classification.
  - Used **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)** for capturing semantic meaning in texts.
  - Applied **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for more complex classification tasks.
  - Explored **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)** to uncover hidden relationships in text data.
